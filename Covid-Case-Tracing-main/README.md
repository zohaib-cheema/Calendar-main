# Covid Virus Tracking

I engineered a C++ Application to mitigate the spread of the pandemic virus at my University's campus.

Utilizng this application users and instituions can track recent physical contacts by processing physical reported movement reports using CSV files using contact:
- Name
- Times
- Locations
- Close Contacts
- Means of Contact

Applicaiton output reports of infected patients and their recent contacts to warn them and mitigate the spread of Covid-19 and informs possibily infected patients via email or mobile.

The application utilizes:
- Covid Data API
- Global Datasets
- CSV Validity Checks
